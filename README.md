A Snake Game

- Developed a Snake game using Python and Pygame,a gameplay experience with a grid size of 20x20.
- Implemented smooth snake movement with a speed of 10 pixels per frame, allowing for responsive user controls.
- Designed a food generation system, spawning a new food item at a random position on the grid after the snake
consumes the current food. Implemented collision detection, ensuring the game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the grid or its own body.
- Utilized Pygame for graphics rendering, creating a visually appealing game interface with a consistent frame rate of 30 frames per second. Implemented user input handling, allowing players to control the snakeâ€™s direction using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
